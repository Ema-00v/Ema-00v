- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Ema-00v, but you can call me Ema (just Ema, thanks)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in drought in a multidimensional and interdisciplinary sense, integrating more classic hydrological approaches and qualitative approaches informed by political ecology
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to work with drought index series as well as how to conduct surveys on drought
